# Green-Status-Analysis

This repository will contain the data, functions, and code associated with my masters research.

Currently the repository contains:
- Data to be analysed (in the data folder) -> this will be updated as more assessments are completed, and more predictors are added to the dataset.
- Functions that are used (in the functions folder)
- R markdown files to a) test for normality and colinearity in the predictors AND b) to compare predictor values for felid and canid species for statistical matching whilst selecting canid species.
